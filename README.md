# CircoCero-PTBR

Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR) Translation for StepMania 5.3 "CircoCero"

## This is for StepMania Outfox 5.3

StepMania 5.0/5.1 does not have fallback translated into pt-BR and I don't want to do so. 5.3 has already a fallback translated to pt-BR that you can find [here](https://github.com/Tiny-Foxes/OutfoxPTBR).

This translation also targets [this version of CircoCero](https://github.com/Tiny-Foxes/sm5-legacy) that's being optimized for [StepMania Outfox 5.3](https://projectmoon.dance/) by [Jose_Varela](https://github.com/JoseVarelaP).
